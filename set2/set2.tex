\paragraph{1)} B. 0.01

	See the Hoeffding code. For 100,000 repititions, the average value of v_min was about 0.0376.

\paragraph{2)} D. c_1 and c_rand

	See the Hoeffding code. For 100,000 repititions, the average value of c_1 and c_rand were about 0.5. This satisifies the single-bin Hoeffding Inequality because it
